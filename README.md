# PROCAT
### Product Catalogue Dataset for Implicit Clustering, Permutation Learning and Structure Prediction

### Introduction
This repository contains the code and dependency specification required for
 running repeated experiments on the titular dataset, which is publicly available under the CC BY-NC-SA license [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14709507).

PROCAT is a dataset of over 10,000 product catalogues consisting of more than 1.5 million individual product offers. This dataset lends itself to machine learning research in the area of set-to-sequence structure prediction, clustering and permutation learning.

It contains the **text** features of offers grouped into sections such as these:
